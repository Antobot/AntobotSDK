# antobot_joystick_teleop

Joystick teleoperation of the robot. Please see the diagram below for our suggested and basic joystick operation for use with the SDK. 

The code may not work properly if you choose to use a joystick with a different configuration. Joystick configuration can be updated in an existing or new .yaml file in ../joystick_drivers/joy/config/, and referenced in the antobot_tel_joy.launch file.
