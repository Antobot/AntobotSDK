local_costmap:
#global_frame parameter defines what coordinate frame the costmap should run in
  global_frame: map
#robot_base_frame parameter defines the coordinate frame the costmap should reference for the base of the robot. 
  robot_base_frame: base_link
  
#update_frequency parameter determines the frequency, in Hz, at which the costmap will run its update loop
  update_frequency: 3.0
#publish_frequency parameter determines the rate, in Hz, at which the costmap will publish visualization information.
  publish_frequency: 3.0

#static_map parameter determines whether or not the costmap should initialize itself based on a map served by the map_server
  #static_map: false
#rolling_window parameter to true means that the costmap will remain centered around the robot as the robot moves through the world
  rolling_window: true
  always_send_full_costmap: true


#The width, height,and resolution parameters set the width (meters), height (meters), and resolution (meters/cell) of the costmap
 
  width: 7.0
  height: 7.0

  
  resolution: 0.1
